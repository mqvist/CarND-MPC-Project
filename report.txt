1. Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators
   and update equations.

The state consists of car x and y position, orientation psi, speed, cross-track
error and orientation error. The actuators are steering angle and throttle. All
the update equations are the same as in the lessons, the only exceptio being the
limits for the throttle that had to be modified slightly.


2. Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt
   (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details
   the previous values tried.

The N and dt have the same values as in the lessons. These values seemed to work
well and I did not need to tune them.


3. If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators
   prior to the MPC procedure it is described.

The waypoints are transformed to the car coordinates before fitting the
polynomial. This has the benefit that the car pose (x, y and psi) in the state
can be set to zero in each time step.


4. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.

I dealt with the latency by using the actuator values that are two time steps in
the future. Because the time step is 50ms this results to effectively predicting
100ms ahead, which is exactly the amount of latency in this case.
